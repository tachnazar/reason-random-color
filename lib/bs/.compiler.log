  We've found a bug for you!
  c:\Users\tachm\Desktop\reason-random-color\src\Index.re:2:38-45
  
  1 │ switch (ReactDOM.querySelector("#root")) {
  2 │     | Some(root) => ReactDOM.render(<Greeting name="John" />, root)
  3 │     | None => ()
  4 │     }
  
  The module or file Greeting can't be found.
  - If it's a third-party dependency:
    - Did you list it in bsconfig.json?
    - Did you run `bsb` instead of `bsb -make-world`
      (latter builds third-parties)?
  - Did you include the file's directory in bsconfig.json?
